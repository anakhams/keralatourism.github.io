      <h1>Welcome To KERALA! - GOD'S OWN COUNTRY</h1>
      <p>
        Kerala, southwestern coastal state of India. Kerala stretches for about
        360 miles (580 km) along the Malabar Coast, varying in width from
        roughly 20 to 75 miles (30 to 120 km). It is bordered by the states of
        Karnataka (formerly Mysore) to the north and Tamil Nadu to the east and
        by the Arabian Sea to the south and west; it also surrounds Mahe, a
        segment of the state of Puducherry, on the northwestern coast. The
        capital is Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum). Although isolated from the
        Indian interior by the mountainous belt of the Western Ghats, Kerala has
        been exposed to many foreign influences via its long coastline;
        consequently, the state has developed a unique culture within the
        subcontinent, not only with a diverse religious tradition but also with
        its own language, Malayalam. Also notable is the high social status that
        continues to be accorded to women of Kerala, owing to the former
        strength of a matrilineal kinship system. Area 15,005 square miles
        (38,863 square km). Pop. (2011) 33,387,677.
